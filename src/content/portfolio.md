      - **User Research**: Identified primary personas like busy parents and young adults managing their health independently.
      - **Wireframing**: Created low-fidelity sketches to map out key flows (e.g., selecting patient, starting new case, viewing health card).
      - **Prototyping**: Built interactive prototypes in **Figma**, emphasizing simplicity, clarity, and accessibility.
      - **Visual Design**: Applied a clean, health-oriented color palette and icon system for intuitive navigation.
      - **Usability Testing**: Collected early feedback from peers and iterated to improve information hierarchy and mobile usability.

      ### Tools Used
      - **Figma** for wireframing, prototyping, and visual design
      - **Design Tokens** and components for consistency
      - **Auto Layout** and variants for responsive behavior

      ### Learning Outcome
      This project deepened my understanding of user-centered healthcare design, mobile-first layout strategy, and the importance of managing multiple user personas (e.g., adult + child view).  
      It also strengthened my skills in design systems, user flow mapping, and presenting a seamless digital experience for a sensitive and important use case like health management.

Hello! My name is Odai and I enjoy creating digital experiences that are intuitive and engaging.  
At Hyper Island, I’ve worked with JavaScript, React, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and explored backend tools like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.  

I’ve collaborated in cross-functional teams using Agile and Design Thinking methods, building projects like an e-commerce platform, movie trailer player, school website for Litorina Folkhögskola, and a startup concept for a haircut booking app.  

I’m currently looking forward to growing as a **Frontend Developer** during my search for an internship.
