Dealing with us as a client without any inhouse competency when it comes to website design and management, he was a great communicator and made the process easy.

      - **Prototyping**: Built interactive prototypes in **Figma**, emphasizing simplicity, clarity, and accessibility.
      - **Visual Design**: Applied a clean, health-oriented color palette and icon system for intuitive navigation.

      ### Tools Used
      - **Figma** for wireframing, prototyping, and visual design
      - **Design Tokens** and components for consistency
      - **Auto Layout** and variants for responsive behavior

      ### Learning Outcome
      This project deepened my understanding of user-centered healthcare design, mobile-first layout strategy, and the importance of managing multiple user personas (e.g., adult + child view).  
      It also strengthened my skills in design systems, user flow mapping, and presenting a seamless digital experience for a sensitive and important use case like health management.

Hey, I’m Odai.. a Frontend Developer student at Hyper Island and a current intern at **Aeoflo**, where I’m building real Shopify tools with **React**, **Remix**, and **TypeScript**.

Working at Aeoflo has been a crash course in real-world development: debugging complex systems, collaborating with designers and backend engineers, and learning how to turn rough ideas into smooth, production-ready apps.

At Hyper Island, I’ve built everything from a **Next.js e-commerce store** to a **3D space exploration app**,  each project teaching me something new about code, design, and how people experience the web.

I love solving problems that mix creativity and logic,  and when I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me cooking 🍋.

I’m currently looking for new opportunities to keep growing as a **Frontend Developer** and contribute to projects that make people’s digital lives a bit more enjoyable.
